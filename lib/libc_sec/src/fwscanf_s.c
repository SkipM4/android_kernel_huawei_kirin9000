/*
 * <FUNCTION DESCRIPTION>
 *    The fwscanf_s function  is  the  wide-character  equivalent  of the fscanf_s function
 *    The fwscanf_s function reads data from the current position of stream into
 *    the locations given by argument (if any). Each argument must be a pointer
 *    to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in format.
 *    format controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same
 *    form and function as the format argument for scanf.
 *
 * <INPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    stream                   Pointer to FILE structure.
 *    format                   Format control string, see Format Specifications.
 *    ...                      Optional arguments.
 *
 * <OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
 *    ...                      The converted value stored in user assigned address
 *
 * <RETURN VALUE>
 *    Each of these functions returns the number of fields successfully converted
 *    and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but
 *    not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned.
 *    return -1 if an error occurs.
